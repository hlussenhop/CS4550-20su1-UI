We want to create a web application where students can find other people taking their courses and form study groups. Since schools have now transitioned to online learning, this web application is especially important for students. Students want to be able to know who is in their courses, connect with their classmates, and study with them. Moderators will be needed so that students canâ€™t create fake courses or delete courses. The students will be able to join a course, engage in text conversations with other students, join a study group for that course, and potentially join a video call with the study group.
